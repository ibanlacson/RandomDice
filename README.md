# Instructions
Create a Dice class using the Random Function. The class should return the value to the onCreate() block and prints out the number of sides and the number rolled example “You have rolled 6 on your 6 sided dice”

The onCreate() block should roll 3 dices with different number of sides (example: 6,20,40)

Create a “lucky number” variable in the Dice class for each dice (For example the 6 sided dice will have a lucky number within the range of 1-6) which will then be evaluated inside the dice class as a private function and will print out “You have rolled the lucky number of 6 in your 6 sided dice” if the roll is the lucky number if not print out “No luck, try again”

On the Android Side,

Create a checkbox to enable the lucky number or not and have a EditText that will show the name on a Toast if you win or not
